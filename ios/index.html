<h2>AeroGear iOS</h2>
<p>If your application uses standard RESTful practices to communicate with a remote backend, requires authentication (including two-factor authentication support with OTP), user enrollment and ways to store and filter objects or APNs for push notifications, then we encourage you to give the library a spin. More exciting new features are currently in progress such as offline, data sync, crypto and much much more. Stay tuned!</p>
