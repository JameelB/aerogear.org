        <p>***MUST UPDATE TO iOS SPECIFIC***To take your app to the next level and gain performance improvements and access to more restricted APIs that Cordova can't yet reach, you may want to go native. AeroGear has you covered there as well! Whether your developing an iOS or an Android app, by using AeroGear.dmg or AeroGear.jar you'll have the same easy to use APIs as the mobile web but specific to the native environment you're working in.</p>
