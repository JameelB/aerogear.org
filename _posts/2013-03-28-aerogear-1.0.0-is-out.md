A huge thank you to the AeroGear team and the open source community!

## Recap

In the last FIXME month we have been busy in implementing our ideas for a 1.0.0 release. As you know, the library offers three overall components

* Mobile Client SDKs (for Android, JavaScript and iOS)
* Server Side Framework (the Controller)
* Security accross all the layers (server and client)

## Highlights

### Android
AeroGear for Android provides libraries to connect to remote RESTful services.  It can integrate with the Android application life cycle and provides robust facilities for authentication, authorization, pagination, and local storage.  We have support for versions of Android starting with Android 2.3.3.  

A Pipe can be backed by a Loader with one line of code.  This allows AeroGear to function in sync with the Android Activity life cycle.  Rotating your phone will not crash your application or hammer your server with requests for the same data over and over again.

We have several abstract implementations of the Callback interface which, when extended by your code, will be injected by AeroGear with the correct Activity or Fragment.  This allows for a clean separation between the Activity and AeroGear which means fewer memory leaks and better stability.

Our Authentication APIs provide an easy way to log in to, enroll in, and log out of remote services.  This API will manage your session tokens and data hand-in-hand with the Pipe API.  This means that you can easily access secured resources on RESTful servers.  Authentication was designed to be extensible and pluggable so it can connect to services which are not backed by AeroGear's Controller server.

Our Paging API provides out of the box support for Web link headers, and extracting URIs for paging information from the body of JSON responses.  Paging through your remote data is as simple as calling next.  The Paging API also provides hooks for extension as well to support your own use cases.

Finally, there is a local data store API.  Your data can be cached locally either in memory or in a SQLite database.  You can also implement your own Store types and configure AeroGear to manage them for you.
