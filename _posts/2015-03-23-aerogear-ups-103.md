The AeroGear team is happy to announce the version 1.0.3 of the UnifiedPush Server! The release focuses on stabilization and adds a few new features

* Migration support for 1.0.x users as explained in our [user guide](https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#migration-guide)
* Keycloak version update to 1.0.5
* Handing APNs errors with bad iOS device tokens
* Improvements on internal storage of device metadata

The complete list of included items are avialble on our [JIRA instance](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGPUSH/fixforversion/12325082/)

###  Openshift

The community cartridge of our UnifiedPush Server, running on WildFly, has been updated and 1.0.3 is usable today. You can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/aerogear/openshift-origin-cartridge-aerogear-push), or launch the server directly on [OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_type/quickstart!31), using our community quickstart.

### Next release

This is the last release of the 1.0.x series. The team is already focused on getting 1.1.0 out. In a few weeks there will be a release of 1.1.0-alpha.2. The 1.1.0 version of the UnifiedPush Server already supports additional push networks, such as Amazon or Windows.
