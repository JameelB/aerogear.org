This release is all about stabilization towards our final release, which is at hand!

A huge thank you to the AeroGear team and the open source community!

## New features

Besides the major focus on cleaning out APIs, we also added a few new features like:

- AeroGear Store’s filter method got implemented to query a subset of the stored data
- AeroGear Pipe: `cancel` method to terminate (running) requests e.g. in case of Application shutdown.
- AeroGear Pipe: `timeout` configuration parameter.
- AeroGear Controller was improved with support to custom headers, media types, pagination and friends.
- AeroGear.js: Replacing ag-ajax with jQuery
- AeroGear security was updated with the PicketLink Alpha release (yes, we live on the edge!). 
- HSTS (*HTTP Strict Transport Security*) based on [RFC 6797](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797) was fully implemented as an additional security policy mechanism.
- AeroGear controller demo (https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-controller-demo) and our TODO app (https://github.com/aerogear/TODO) were updated with the latest bits from AG Controller and Security.
