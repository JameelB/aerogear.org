The AeroGear team is happy to announce the version 1.1.0 of the UnifiedPush Server! Over the last year we have developed several new features on our 1.1.0 release series, with a two alpha and four beta releases. The highlights of this release are:

* Microsoft’s Windows Push Notification service (WNS)
* Microsoft’s Push Notification service (MPNs)
* Amazon Device Messaging (ADM) - _experimental_
* Analytics and Push Metrics
* An all new Admin UI 
* JMS based architecture 
* Device metadata import
* Java-8 support
* New REST API doc (miredot)

As well as several fixes and improvements! 

## Openshift

The community cartridge of our UnifiedPush Server, running on WildFly, has been updated and 1.1.0 is usable today. You can find the source code on [Github](https://github.com/aerogear/openshift-origin-cartridge-aerogear-push), or launch the server directly on [OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_type/quickstart!31), using our community quickstart.


## Older and future releases

The old 1.0.x series got its last 1.0.3 release and we have no plans to do any updates on this version. For the 1.1.x series we expect some improvements, before the community moves forward with 1.2.0 and 1.3.0 releases. For details please consult our planed releases in [JIRA](https://issues.jboss.org/projects/AGPUSH?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page)!
