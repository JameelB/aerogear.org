We are happy to announce that the 2.0.0 version of our Android library has been released!

## What is new ?

Since the last 1.4.0 release in June, the team has been extremely busy working on several new features. Our own Hoyt Summers Pittman has all the details in [his personal blog](https://blog.sagaoftherealms.net/?p=519).

We hope you will enjoy this release!
