title: Announcing AeroGear Mobile Services on OpenShift
author: aerogear
---

Over the past six months, the AeroGear team has been busy with a new vision for building mobile applications on OpenShift. Until now, the AeroGear project has primarily focused on Push Notifications; we're expanding the suite of services we offer today to include a number of other Mobile Services for use in your applications on OpenShift.

AeroGear provides a suite of Mobile Services across a range of native (iOS & Android) and hybrid client SDKs (including Xamarin & Cordova) that will simplify your mobile and modern application development needs, leveraging OpenShift's Container technology to provide a secure, scalable backend platform.

We're really excited about what we've been building, and would encourage you to [get started](https://docs.aerogear.org/aerogear/latest/getting-started.html) with AeroGear today.

### What about FeedHenry?

The [FeedHenry project](http://feedhenry.org) is the upstream for our current RHMAP product. AeroGear Services is a different project which looks at Mobile development use-cases embedded within OpenShift. The efforts of both communities will separate at this point.
