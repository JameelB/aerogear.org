We are happy to announce that the [Unified Push Server 1.1.0-alpha.2](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/releases/tag/1.1.0-alpha.2) has been released ! 

## What is new ?

The biggest noticeable change is the advent of an all new UI. The focus was on improving ease of use, and supporting user with wizzards as much as possible. Another huge change is that we added JMS support for improved scaling, which in consequence means the UPS now requires a full profile server. We also added support for iOS 8.3 and Watch Kit push notifications!

Besides that, a bunch of bugs have been fixed, you can check the full list [here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGPUSH/fixforversion/12326455/).

Stay tuned for the next release!
