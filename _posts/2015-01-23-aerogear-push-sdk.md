title: AeroGear iOS Push-SDK for Swift v1.0
author: corinnekrych
module: push
---

Since [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) language seems to have stabilize a bit and _no big changes_ have occurred on the last Xcode releases, we thought it will be good idea to release a v1.0 port of our [Push-SDK library](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push) for those that are interested in and staring a new project that utilize the language.

So, we have tagged and released the port on [github](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-push/archive/1.0.0-swift.zip) as well as on [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=aerogear-push-swift).  (If you use Cocoapods you will need to ensure the _‘-pre’_ release is installed that brings support for Swift frameworks, more information can be found on the [Cocoapods blog post](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Pod-Authors-Guide-to-CocoaPods-Frameworks/)).

Our [HelloWorld](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-helloworld/tree/swift/ios-swift) and [Contacts](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-quickstarts/tree/swift/client/contacts-mobile-ios-client-swift) quick-starts have also been ported, and been updated to the latest Push-SDK release.

So go ahead give our library and demos a spin and let us know what you think.

Enjoy!
