# Community

As an open-source project, the AeroGear community has many entry points. We welcome your participation in any way that matches your level of interest.

Read this page to learn about our community resources. Keep in mind that contributing code is not the only way to get involved. You can provide feedback on documentation and tutorials, test the releases, share your visions, or just participate in the IRC or mailing list discussions. The various entry points are summarized below. See you there!

## Chat (IRC)

We invite you to join us in the [#aerogear](irc://irc.freenode.net/aerogear) channel on irc.freenode.net to chat about AeroGear and other topics related to mobile. 

This channel is logged to [transcripts.jboss.org](http://transcripts.jboss.org/channel/irc.freenode.org/%23aerogear/index.html).

If you donâ€™t have an IRC client installed or available, you can use the [web-based client](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=aerogear) on this site to join the #aerogear channel.

## Mailing lists

The AeroGear team has two mailing lists

### User list

This list is the right place for general user questions such as how to configure, use or even troubleshoot the different AeroGear projects. [Subscribe](https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/aerogear-users) to the list before posting. Older threads can be read in its [archive](http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/aerogear-users/).


### Developer list

This is a mailing list geared towards developing AeroGear itself. It often contains deep, technical discussions on how AeroGear works internally, how new features could be implemented. [Subscribe](https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/aerogear-dev) to the list before posting. Older threads can be read in its [archive](http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/aerogear-dev/).

## Source Repository

All the AeroGear source code is managed using the distributed version system [git](http://git-scm.com/) and hosted in sub-modules of the [aerogear organization](https://github.com/aerogear) at github.com.

Both git and github are awesome for collaboration! To make improvements or bug fixes to the AeroGear project, simply fork one of the project's repositories, commit your changes and send a pull request.

For more information on our GitHub workflow, please visit this [page](../docs/guides/GitHubWorkflow/) that describes the steps in-detail.
