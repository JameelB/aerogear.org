AeroGear Persistence 1.0.0 - DRAFT
==================================


Common Client Requirements
--------------------------

*TODO* Extract and common client 

__Client-side validation__

* Extending Bean Validation out to the client libraries
** Separate metadata service would be required
*** If combined would complicate, and effect performance of standard requests
*** Companion endpoint definition required
*** This companion endpoint would be used for more than just client validation

__Server-side Technology Agnostic__

* The specific type of server-side structure, connectivity, standard support should be swappable
** Needs to have a default RESTful template implementation
*** Have a basic template, and then the ability to model variations
** Support for other adapters such as OData, Websocket, etc...
