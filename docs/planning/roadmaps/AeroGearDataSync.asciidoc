AeroGear DataSync Roadmap
=========================
:Author: Daniel Bevenius

0.1.0 (Apr, 2015) Data Sync
---------------------------
Full _real-time_ data sync where updates are initiated from both the client and server over a bi-directional channel. + 
This version also supports persistent storage of updates to support offline work. + 
This version requires both a specific server side sync engine, as well as a client side sync engine. + 

[NOTE]
============================
The algorithm that the server should use is still not decided. +
Current candidates are Operational Transformation (OT) and Differential Synchronization (DS)
