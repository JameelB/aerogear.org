AeroGear DataSync Roadmap
=========================
:Author: Daniel Bevenius

0.1.0 (Apr, 2015) link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-1374[Data Sync]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full _real-time_ data sync where updates are initiated from both the client and server over a bi-directional channel. + 
This version requires both a specific server side sync engine, as well as a client side sync engine. + 

[NOTE]
============================
The algorithm that the server should use is still not decided. +
Current candidates are Operational Transformation (OT) and Differential Synchronization (DS)
============================

AeroGear
~~~~~~~~
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-XXX[AEROGEAR-XXX] Implement Server Sync Engine + 
The server side component of the synchronization protocol (OT or DS).

Android
~~~~~~~

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGDROID-XXX[AGDROID-XXX] Implement Client Sync Engine + 
Depending on the chosen implementation (OT or DS) the client sync engine might already be provided. This
is the case for DS the server is implemented in Java and also provides a client engine. 

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGDROID-XXX[AGDROID-XXX] Implement Sync Client + 
A client facing API for Android users wishing to synchronize data. This would use the ClientSyncEngine to
handling the synchronizing itself, but can provide/customize the storage of data, choose the most appropriate network transport
protocol.

iOS

A client facing API for iOS users wishing to synchronize data. This would use the ClientSyncEngine to 
handling the synchronizing itself, but can provide/customize the storage of data, choose the most appropriate network transport
protocol.

A client facing API for JavaScript users wishing to synchronize data. This would use the ClientSyncEngine to 
handling the synchronizing itself, but can provide/customize the storage of data, choose the most appropriate network transport
protocol.

0.2.0 (May, 2015) link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-XXX[Offline]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version also supports persistent storage of updates to support offline work. + 

Android
~~~~~~~

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGDROID-XXX[AGDROID-XXX] Implement Offline support for Sync Client + 
The Sync Client should be able to handle working offline, and when a network connection becomes avialable connect
and synchronize with the server.
