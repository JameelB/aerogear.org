Debugging the UnifiedPush Server
---------------------------------

There are several ways to learn more about _"What's going on"_ inside the UnifiedPush Server

Enable Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UnifiedPush Server internally uses +java.util.logging+ as its logging framework.


WildFly and JBoss AS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable detailed logging for the UnifiedPush Server, open the +$SERVER_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml+ file of the server and navigate to the _logging_ subsystem. Inside of the +<subsystem>+ element you need to add the following XML snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<console-handler name="AEROGEAR">
    <formatter>
        <pattern-formatter pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss,SSS} %-5p [%c] (%t) %s%E%n"/>
    </formatter>
</console-handler>
<logger category="org.jboss.aerogear.unifiedpush" use-parent-handlers="false">
    <level name="FINEST"/>
    <handlers>
        <handler name="AEROGEAR"/>
    </handlers>
</logger>
----

Once done save the file and start the server. At this point all log levels from the UnifiedPush Server are enabled. To verify this, you can send a Push Notification from the Admin Console. The console should print a message like:

[source,shell]
----
17:30:50,571 FINE  [org.jboss.aerogear.unifiedpush.rest.sender.PushNotificationSenderEndpoint]
   (http--127.0.0.1-8080-1) Message sent by: 'AeroGear UnifiedPush Console'
----

Dashboard of the AdminUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AdminUI contains a _Dashboard_ which provides a number of valuable information as well:

* The +Most Active+ section shows a recent list of PushApplications that have submitted Push Notification requests. Learn more link:../admin-ui/#_dashboard_most_active[here].

* The +Warnings+ section shows of a list of recent problems that occured. Learn more link:../admin-ui/_dashboard_warnings[here]
