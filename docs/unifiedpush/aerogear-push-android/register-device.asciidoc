The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server
-------------------------------

With all the Google work being done, we are now ready to setup the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server[UnifiedPush Server], so that it can be used to connect to CGM for a later message sending.

AeroGear Unified Push Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ defines a logical _abstraction_ for Mobile Applications that have support for different Push Networks. Its _Push Applications_ can have different "Variants". For this tutorial we'll need to create a _Push Application_ which will contain one Android Variant. Details on the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server are discussed link:http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-server-push/[here].

For the purpose of the guide, we will fall back to the command line and the _CURL_ tool to perform the registrations with the server. In the near feature, a tutorial using Push Administration console will be provided (currently in the works).

=== Login to the server

Prior to perform any work with the server, we need to login first. A temporary user 'admin:123' has already been configured, but for security reasons we need to change the password at first login. 

Let's first login to the server:

We now must update admin user's password:

We are now logged in:

=== Register a Push Application 

Now that we are logged in, let's create a new _Push Application_.  Click on the **Applications** tab to bring up the Applications screen.

Click **Create Application** to bring up the application dialog.

Click **Create** in the dialog to create your application.

=== Register an Android Variant

From your application's card, click **No Variants** to add a variant.

Click the **Add Variant** button. And fill out the Android options.  You will want to use the **Client ID** and **Project Number** from the *Google API Console* in their appropriate fields.

Click **Add** and your variant will be created.

Expand the variant card and make note of the **Variant ID** and **Secret** fields. Both will be used later when registering your installation through the Android client SDK.

The server is now configured. Time to link:../android-app[create an Android application] that will use the AeroGear Android library to connect to the UnifiedPush server and start receiving notifications.
