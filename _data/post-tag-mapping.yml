# README:

#  FORMAT:
#     source: target
#
#  - '=releases', '=platform' and '=module' categories will be treated differently - they
#    don't show up in tag list, they have own sorting mechanism
#  - simple tag mappings are replacements, one tag will replace another (such as 'unifiedpush: push'
#    implies that unifiedpush tag will be replaced by simple push (that will later be treated such as module)
#  - the tag starting with + means implications (additions) - the tag will be added (such as 'oauth2: +security'
#    implies that in addition to oauth2, the post will be categorized as security (which is recognized as module
#    by another mapping)
#  - the use of empty tag '' means removing the given tag altogether
