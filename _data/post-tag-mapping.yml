#  FORMAT:
#     source: target
#
#  - 'releases', 'platform' and 'module' categories will be treated differently - they
#    don't show up in tag list, they have own sorting mechanism
#  - other tags are mappings, one tag will imply another (such as 'oauth2: security'
#    implies that oauth2 will get tag security, which is in fact module, so 'oauth2'
#    tags will be categorized as being security module)
#  - the tag ending with ! symbol acts as renaming, such as 'unifiedpush: push!' means
#    that 'unifiedpush' won't show up at all, the 'push' tag will be instead, which will
#    be at the end treated as 'module'
#  - the use of '!' means we want to remove the tag altogether, e.g. 'mobile: !'
